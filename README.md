# 📄 Browser OCR — Private, Client-Side Text Extraction

A fast, privacy-first OCR web application that extracts text from images **entirely in the browser** using **Tesseract.js**.
No uploads. No tracking. No servers.

Designed with **performance, accessibility, and real-world UX** in mind.

## 🧠 OCR Presets (Why They Matter)

Presets adjust preprocessing and expectations for different image types:

| Preset                 | Best For                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 📄 Scanned Document    | PDFs, printed pages            |
| 🖥 Screenshot / UI     | Apps, tables, code             |
| 📝 Notes / Handwriting | Class notes, rough writing     |
| 📸 Camera Photo        | Mobile photos, uneven lighting |

Presets also power **status messaging**, so users understand what’s happening.

## ⚡ Smart Image Downscaling

Large images (e.g. phone photos) are automatically resized before OCR.

* Improves speed (often 2–4× faster)
* Reduces memory usage
* Prevents mobile browser crashes
* Can be turned **ON/OFF** in Advanced settings

---

## ♿ Accessibility & UX

* `aria-live` status updates for screen readers
* Keyboard shortcuts:

  * **Enter** → Start OCR
  * **Esc** → Cancel OCR
  * **Ctrl / Cmd + C** → Copy result
* Clear progress + ETA to reduce perceived waiting time

---

## 🧹 Performance & Memory Safety

* Object URLs are revoked after use
* Image previews cleaned up after OCR
* No persistent workers or leaked references
* Safe for mobile and low-memory devices

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Bootstrap 5**
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
* **Tesseract.js (WebAssembly OCR)**

No frameworks. No build step. No backend.

## ⚠️ Limitations

* OCR accuracy depends on image quality
* Handwritten text may be inconsistent
* Very large batches can be slow on low-end devices

These are limitations of **client-side OCR**, not the app itself.
