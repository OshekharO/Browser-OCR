## Contributing to Browser OCR

Thanks for your interest in improving the project! A few quick notes to keep contributions simple and consistent:

1. **Run locally**
   - Ensure PHP 8.x is available.
   - From the repo root run `php -S localhost:8000` and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

2. **Coding style**
   - Keep changes minimal and focused.
   - Prefer semantic HTML and Bootstrap utility classes for layout and spacing.
   - Avoid adding new dependencies unless strictly necessary.

3. **Testing**
   - Manually verify uploads and OCR in the browser after UI changes.
   - If you change OCR options, test with at least one low-DPI and one clear scan.

4. **Pull requests**
   - Describe what changed and why.
   - Include screenshots for UI updates.
   - Note any limitations or follow-up ideas.
